/Users/zinc/Documents/code/gradle/GradleStudy/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:5: Warning: On SDK version 23 and up, your app data will be automatically backed up and restored on app install. Consider adding the attribute android:fullBackupContent to specify an @xml resource which configures which files to backup. More info: https://developer.android.com/training/backup/autosyncapi.html [AllowBackup]

     ~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "AllowBackup":
   The allowBackup attribute determines if an application's data can be backed
   up and restored. It is documented at
   http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#allowBackup

   By default, this flag is set to true. When this flag is set to true,
   application data can be backed up and restored by the user using adb backup
   and adb restore.

   This may have security consequences for an application. adb backup allows
   users who have enabled USB debugging to copy application data off of the
   device. Once backed up, all application data can be read by the user. adb
   restore allows creation of application data from a source specified by the
   user. Following a restore, applications should not assume that the data,
   file permissions, and directory permissions were created by the application
   itself.

   Setting allowBackup="false" opts an application out of both backup and
   restore.

   To fix this warning, decide whether your application should support backup,
   and explicitly set android:allowBackup=(true|false)".

   If not set to false, and if targeting API 23 or later, lint will also warn
   that you should set android:fullBackupContent to configure auto backup.

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.

   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests=true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests=true.

/Users/zinc/Documents/code/gradle/GradleStudy/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xhdpi/t11.jpg: Warning: The following unrelated icon files have identical contents: t1.jpg, t11.jpg [IconDuplicates]
Also affects:
     /Users/zinc/Documents/code/gradle/GradleStudy/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xhd
     pi/t1.jpg

   Explanation for issues of type "IconDuplicates":
   If an icon is repeated under different names, you can consolidate and just
   use one of the icons and delete the others to make your application
   smaller. However, duplicated icons usually are not intentional and can
   sometimes point to icons that were accidentally overwritten or accidentally
   not updated.
